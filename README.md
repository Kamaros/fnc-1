# fnc-1
Submission for the [Fake News Challenge](http://www.fakenewschallenge.org).
Classifiers are automatically generated by [TPOT](https://rhiever.github.ip/tpot) based on a rich set of extracted features.

## Installation
This implementation was built and tested on Python 3.6.1. Dependencies can be installed via the following commands:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -n spacy download en
```

In addition, the FNC dataset is included as a submodule, and should be downloaded by running the following commands:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Usage
`python fnc-1.py`
During the first run, models and features will be generated for the first time, which may take several hours. Subsequent runs will use cached data, stored in the `caches` directory.
